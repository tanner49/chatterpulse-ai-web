# Israel Delays Judicial Overhaul Amidst Protests
### Protests Erupt Across Israel Over Proposed Judicial Reforms
#### March 28, 2023

## Introduction
Israel has been rocked by protests and strikes over the past week as the government pushed forward with a controversial plan to overhaul the country's judiciary. The plan, which would have given the government more control over the appointment of judges, was met with widespread opposition from critics who say it would undermine Israel's democracy. The protests intensified after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who had criticized the judicial reform proposal. However, on Monday, after a long day of protests, Netanyahu announced a delay to the proposal until the next parliamentary session next month.

## The Sides
Critics of the proposed judicial reforms argue that they would give the government too much power over the judiciary, undermining the independence of the courts and threatening Israel's democracy. Supporters of the reforms, however, argue that they are necessary to ensure that the judiciary is more responsive to the will of the people and that judges are appointed based on their political views.

The delay of the proposed judicial reforms is seen as a victory for the protesters, who have been calling for the government to abandon the plan altogether. However, it remains to be seen whether the government will push forward with the reforms in the next parliamentary session or whether they will be abandoned altogether.
