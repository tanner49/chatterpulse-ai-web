# The Importance of Conversations and Self-Love
### Insights from Various Podcasts
#### March 31, 2023

## Introduction
Conversations are an essential part of our lives, and they can either make or break our relationships. In recent times, there has been a growing concern about the impact of negative comments and toxic positivity on our mental health. However, several podcasts have been discussing the importance of conversations, self-love, and the need to challenge nostalgia. 

On the "On Purpose with Jay Shetty" podcast, the host emphasizes that we are hardwired to look outward to others for validation and satisfaction. He also notes that no matter how imperfect the situation we were born into, we can learn from our karma. Additionally, he discusses how our early impressions affect our future choices and the karma cycle that shapes our lives.

Similarly, on "The Doctor's Farmacy with Mark Hyman, M.D.," Mel Robbins shares tools to break free from negative thought patterns and create self-love. She also unpacks her formula, step by step, for handling challenging conversations.

On the other hand, the "Hard Factor" podcast discusses the impact of hate comments on social media. They highlight the need to address this growing problem and find ways to deal with it.

## The Sides
The podcasts mentioned above highlight the importance of conversations, self-love, and the need to address hate comments. They also emphasize the need to challenge nostalgia and not allow it to define the limits of our lives. However, some podcasts, such as "SHE with Jordan Lee Dooley," discuss the negative impact of toxic positivity and how it can be harmful to our mental health.

Moreover, "The Art of Manliness" podcast discusses the different types of overtalkers and how to avoid conversational narcissism. "EconTalk" also provides insights on how to have a deep conversation, while "Politicology" discusses what having difficult conversations can teach us about engagement and defensiveness.
