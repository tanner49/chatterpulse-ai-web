# The Opioid Crisis: Overdoses, Narcan, and Organ Transplants
### Examining the Latest Developments in the Ongoing Battle Against Opioid Addiction
#### April 03, 2023

## Introduction
The opioid epidemic continues to ravage communities across the United States, with overdoses and deaths continuing to rise. However, there have been some recent developments in the fight against opioid addiction, including the approval of over-the-counter Narcan and proposed changes to the organ transplant system. 

According to The Daily Zeitgeist, Kentucky has shattered its fatal overdose record, with fentanyl being blamed for the increase. However, there are obstacles to the widespread use of over-the-counter Narcan, including price and stigma. The Doctor's Farmacy with Mark Hyman, M.D. explores how Big Food and Big Pharma make money off of our ill health, including the opioid crisis. 

## The Sides
There are different opinions on how to address the opioid crisis. Radiolab talks to people on all sides of the story about stemming the tide of overdoses, while The John Batchelor Show reports that the war on drugs in Colombia has failed badly, with booming cocaine production suggesting that the war on drugs has failed. Hold These Truths with Dan Crenshaw discusses reforming the FDA's approval process for innovative drugs and technologies, while The Young Turks report on how Cigna saves millions by having its doctors reject claims without reading them.
