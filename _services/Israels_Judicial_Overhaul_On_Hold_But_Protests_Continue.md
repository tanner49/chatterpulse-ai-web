# Israel's Judicial Overhaul: On Hold, But Protests Continue
### Netanyahu's decision to delay the controversial reforms sparks nationwide demonstrations
#### April 05, 2023
## Introduction
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to delay the planned overhaul of the country's judicial system, but citizens are still taking to the streets in protest. The government's plans to weaken Israel's supreme court have been subject to months-long demonstrations and general strikes, with walkouts across several industries closing Israel's schools and airports for a day.

## The Sides
On one side, supporters of Netanyahu's proposed reforms argue that they are necessary to maintain the stability of the government. Critics, however, fear that the changes would lead to a quiet slide from democracy and undermine the country's judiciary. The situation has even caught the attention of US President Joe Biden, who publicly called out Netanyahu for attempting to alter Israel's judiciary.
