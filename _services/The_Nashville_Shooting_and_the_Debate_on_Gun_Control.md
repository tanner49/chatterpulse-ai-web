# The Nashville Shooting and the Debate on Gun Control
### Calls for Gun Reform Following the Nashville School Shooting
#### April 01, 2023

## Introduction
The recent school shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville has reignited the debate on gun control in the United States. The shooting, which left several students and teachers dead, has led to protests and calls for stricter gun laws. However, some argue that gun control is not the solution and that mental health should be the focus instead.

## The Sides
Those in favor of gun control argue that it is necessary to prevent such tragedies from happening again. They believe that stricter gun laws, such as background checks and bans on assault weapons, would make it harder for people to obtain firearms and reduce the number of mass shootings. On the other hand, opponents of gun control argue that it is a violation of the Second Amendment and that it would not solve the problem. They believe that mental health is the root cause of mass shootings and that more resources should be allocated to addressing mental health issues.
