# Tennessee Tensions: Gun Control Debate and Expulsion of Democrats
### Chaos erupts in the Tennessee state house following the Nashville school shooting
#### April 05, 2023
## Introduction
In the aftermath of the tragic Covenant School shooting in Nashville, Tennessee, tensions have risen as the debate on gun control takes center stage. Republican lawmakers in Tennessee moved to expel three Democrats for leading a demonstration for gun control, while students staged a walkout to protest gun violence. Meanwhile, President Biden called for reinstating the federal assault weapons ban, sparking further debate on the effectiveness of such measures.

## The Sides
On one side, gun control advocates argue that stricter laws and regulations are necessary to prevent further tragedies. They point to the fact that gun violence recently surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of death for American children. Critics of the current gun laws demand nationwide education strikes and gun reform policies.

On the other side, opponents of gun control argue that the focus should be on mental health and security measures in schools. They claim that the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons ban had virtually no impact on murders and that the vast majority of murders are not committed by what they call assault weapons. Some suggest that armed guards should be present in every school to deter potential shooters.

## What People Are Saying
- "At least 3 duly elected Democratic State Representatives are about to literally be removed from their positions because they participated in a peaceful protest about gun control." - *The Breakdown with Shaun King*
- "Leftists claim that it would cost too much money to put armed security in every school in America." - *The Matt Walsh Show*
- "Is an assault weapons ban where advocates should spend their political capital?" - *The Weeds*
- "Why isnâ€™t every school defended by a badass that killers have to get through?" - *The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show*
- "They'll ban a book before they'll even talk about what to do with assault weapons." - *The New Abnormal*

As the debate continues, the nation watches closely to see how the situation in Tennessee unfolds and what impact it may have on the broader conversation surrounding gun control and school safety.
