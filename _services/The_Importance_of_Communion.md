# The Importance of Communion
### Exploring the Meaning Behind Jesus' Last Supper
#### March 31, 2023

## Introduction
On today's Truth For Life Daily Program, Alistair Begg examines the Last Supper and explores the meaning and importance of Communion. At the Last Supper, Jesus said, “Do this in remembrance of me.” This act of Communion has been a significant part of Christian worship for centuries. However, some podcasts discuss other aspects of faith, including the power of prayer, the importance of perseverance, and the existence of God.

## The Sides
While some podcasts focus on the importance of Communion, others explore different aspects of faith. For example, Joel Osteen Podcast encourages listeners to turn their worries into prayer, while Joyce Meyer Enjoying Everyday Life® TV Audio Podcast shares stories from Scripture to help listeners appreciate God's plan for their lives. The Fr. Mike Schmitz Catholic Podcast discusses why God chose the Jewish people to make manifest his glory, while The Secret To Success with CJ, Karl, Jemal & Eric Thomas encourages listeners to have faith in where God is leading them. 

## What People Are Saying
"Ultimately the purpose of this is to evoke the blessing of the father, and to assist him in his journey into wholeness in the life beyond life," says Aubrey Marcus Podcast. Meanwhile, The Briefing - AlbertMohler.com discusses the courage and faith Christians show in the face of unspeakable evil. "Nothing is certain in life except for death, taxes, and the left using your taxes to push their ideology," says The Charlie Kirk Show. 

In terms of Communion, The Catechism in a Year (with Fr. Mike Schmitz) explains the secrets of the line from the Creed, "he descended into hell," and shows how Jesus’ descent into hell "brings the Gospel message of salvation to complete fulfillment." The podcast also discusses how Jesus did not come to save only the righteous who happened to be alive during his time on earth, but he came to save all those righteous men and women who came before him and would come after him. 

Overall, while different podcasts may focus on different aspects of faith, they all share a common goal of helping listeners grow in their relationship with God.
