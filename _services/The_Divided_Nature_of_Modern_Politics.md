# The Divided Nature of Modern Politics
### How Envy and Tribalism are Affecting Our Politics
#### April 03, 2023

## Introduction
Politics has always been a divisive topic, but in recent years, it seems that the divide has only grown wider. From the failure of Republicans to get a red wave in the midterm elections to Democrats' fight for Washington D.C. statehood, the political landscape is more polarized than ever. But what is causing this division? According to the podcast "No Stupid Questions," envy may be playing a role. Meanwhile, "Stuff To Blow Your Mind" explores how little is required for factions to form. 

## The Sides
On one side, there are those who believe that the decrepit nature of Republican politics is the fault of the people themselves more than the leaders. They warn about the need for restoration and healing from COVID fascism; otherwise, we will face “techno-primitivism” aka a life of hell. On the other side, there are those who argue that the Democratic solution to policies that don't work is always more government, centralization, redistribution, and interference with liberty. They believe that there is a Marxist movement customized towards democracies and the Republic, and we are currently in a soft tyranny. 

## What People Are Saying
- "Humans obviously don’t have any difficulties finding division and tribalism, but just how little is required for factions to form?" - Stuff To Blow Your Mind
- "Knowing this, the right must adopt a change in mindset before it's too late." - The Jesse Kelly Show
- "There is a Marxist movement customized towards democracies and the Republic, and we are currently in a soft tyranny." - Mark Levin Podcast
- "Politics has gotten way more extreme since 2018." - Hold These Truths with Dan Crenshaw
- "The crappy life of a politician." - The Jesse Kelly Show

It's clear that there are strong opinions on both sides of the political spectrum. While some believe that envy and tribalism are contributing to the divide, others argue that it's the fault of the people themselves or a Marxist movement. Regardless of the cause, it's clear that the political landscape is more polarized than ever, and it's up to all of us to work towards finding common ground.
