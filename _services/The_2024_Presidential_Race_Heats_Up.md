# The 2024 Presidential Race Heats Up
### A plethora of potential candidates and opinions emerge as the battle for the White House begins
#### April 19, 2023
## Introduction
As the 2024 presidential race kicks into high gear, a colorful cast of characters has emerged, sparking debates and discussions across the political spectrum. From Chris Christie to Tim Scott, and even Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the list of potential candidates is as diverse as it is entertaining.

With the Republican primary heating up and the Democratic side facing its own challenges, the stage is set for a showdown that will undoubtedly captivate the nation. So, buckle up, folks, because this rollercoaster ride is just getting started!

## The Sides
On the Republican side, the primary is already seeing a surge in attacks and spending, with some questioning whether it's worth challenging Trump, given his significant advantages in fundraising, polling, and political talent. Meanwhile, others like Tim Scott and Asa Hutchinson are launching exploratory committees and campaigns, hoping to make their mark and secure the GOP nomination.

The Democratic side faces its own hurdles, with growing calls for Senator Feinstein to resign and concerns about her absence from the Senate. This has led to a slowdown in the confirmation of judges, further complicating the party's efforts to balance out Trump and McConnell's court-packing.
