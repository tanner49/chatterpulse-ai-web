# Fox News Settles with Dominion for $787M
### The largest publicly known defamation settlement in U.S. history involving a media company
#### April 19, 2023
## Introduction
In a last-minute settlement, Fox News has agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems a whopping $787 million, narrowly avoiding a trial over the network's amplification of false election-fraud claims. The settlement marks the largest publicly known defamation settlement in U.S. history involving a media company.

## The Sides
Dominion Voting Systems sued Fox News for $1.6 billion, claiming the cable network aired defamatory claims about its role in the 2020 election. The case has highlighted tension between prime-time hosts and news personnel at Fox News, as well as the erosion of truth at the network and its impact on democracy. Legal observers have noted that the outcome of the trial could have had a significant impact on libel laws.

## What People Are Saying
- "Fox said in a statement: We acknowledge the court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false." (_The 11th Hour with Stephanie Ruhle_)
- "Dominion uncovered a trove of texts and emails from people at Fox News who knew calling the 2020 election stolen was a lie." (_Slate News_)
- "Fox News desperately trying to settle the Dominion lawsuit before trial." (_Breaking Points with Krystal and Saagar_)
- "The Fox News - Dominion lawsuit and the corporate media's misunderstanding of it." (_The Megyn Kelly Show_)
- "Dominion v. Fox is not only about defamation—it's also about the erosion of truth at the network and its impact on our democracy." (_The Bulwark Podcast_)

In a twist of irony, Fox News was sanctioned by a judge for withholding evidence before the settlement was reached. The case has left many questioning the network's reputation and the potential chilling effect a ruling against Fox News could have had on freedom of the press.
