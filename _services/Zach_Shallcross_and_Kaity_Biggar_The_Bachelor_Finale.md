# Zach Shallcross and Kaity Biggar: The Bachelor Finale
### A Recap of the Drama and Controversy Surrounding Zach's Decision
#### March 31, 2023

## Introduction
Zach Shallcross, the latest Bachelor, has made his final decision and chosen Kaity Biggar as his fianc√©. However, the finale was not without its fair share of drama and controversy. From confrontations with other contestants to comparisons to previous contestants, Zach's journey to find love was anything but smooth sailing. 

During the pandemic, Zach navigated real-life grief, which led him to become a good person, according to the podcast "Fake Doctors, Real Friends with Zach and Donald." However, his decision during the overnight dates was discussed in-depth on the "Reality Steve Podcast" with Dr. Diane, who analyzed the ramifications of his choice. Meanwhile, on "The Viall Files," the hosts debated whether Zach should have told Ariel what happened in the Fantasy Suites and whether Gabi was led on to believe that she would be his final rose pick. 

## The Sides
The different sides of the story are represented by the various podcasts that covered Zach's season of "The Bachelor." On "The Betchelor," Jared gave hot takes on how Zach handled the Fantasy Suites, while Sean Lowe was criticized for being spineless. "Bachelor Party" discussed the heartbreaking end to Gabi Elnicki's journey and what the franchise will look like after news that 'Bachelor' creator Mike Fleiss is leaving the show for good. 

On the other hand, "Off The Vine with Kaitlyn Bristowe" had the happy couple, Zach and Kaity, answering all the burning questions about their relationship and how they dealt with getting hate before and during the season. They also shared how communication has gotten them through the struggles so far and the next steps of their relationship.
