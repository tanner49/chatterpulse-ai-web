# Trump Indicted: A Presidential First
### Former President Donald Trump faces 34 felony counts in Manhattan court
#### April 05, 2023
## Introduction
In a historic turn of events, former President Donald Trump has been charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, making him the first U.S. president to face criminal charges. The case centers around hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and the nation is buzzing with reactions from both supporters and critics.

## The Sides
Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has brought forth the charges, alleging that Trump orchestrated an "unlawful scheme" to help his 2016 campaign and then cover it up. Critics of the former president see this as a long-awaited moment of justice, while Trump's supporters argue that the charges are frivolous and politically motivated.
