# Climate Change: The Urgency of Action
### The World Needs to Act Now to Avoid the Worst Effects of Climate Change
#### April 03, 2023

## Introduction
The latest United Nations climate report has warned that the world has to stop burning fossil fuels if we want to avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. The report has reminded us just how soon that needs to happen. Experts have repeatedly said that the U.S. should cut two-thirds of fossil fuels in the next decade. When it comes to carbon-free energy, many people think of renewables like solar or wind. However, nuclear energy is also being considered as a viable option. Nuclear currently accounts for 20 percent of our electricity production, according to the Energy Information Administration. The anaerobic decomposition of organic material in the waste stream at sewage plants produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The wastewater treatment process may release amounts of methane nearly twice that estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

## The Sides
There are two sides to the issue of climate change. On one hand, there are those who believe that the world needs to take immediate action to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. They argue that the consequences of inaction will be catastrophic, with rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and widespread food and water shortages. On the other hand, there are those who believe that the costs of transitioning to renewable energy sources are too high and that the benefits are uncertain. They argue that the world should continue to rely on fossil fuels until a more cost-effective and reliable alternative is found.

## What People Are Saying
- "The latest United Nations climate report is a wake-up call for the world. We need to take immediate action to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources if we want to avoid the worst effects of climate change." - 1A
- "Nuclear energy is a viable option for a carbon-free future. It currently accounts for 20 percent of our electricity production, and we should consider expanding its use." - 1A
- "The wastewater treatment process may release amounts of methane nearly twice that estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We need to find ways to mitigate the methane impact of treating our citiesâ€™ sewage." - Science Friday
- "The world needs to cut carbon emissions drastically to avoid the worst effects of global warming. We also need to remove 6 to 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year by 2050." - How I Built This with Guy Raz
- "There are those who believe that the costs of transitioning to renewable energy sources are too high and that the benefits are uncertain. They argue that the world should continue to rely on fossil fuels until a more cost-effective and reliable alternative is found." - The Sides

In conclusion, the world needs to take immediate action to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources to avoid the worst effects of climate change. While there are those who believe that the costs of transitioning to renewable energy sources are too high, the consequences of inaction will be catastrophic. It is time for the world to come together and take bold action to address this urgent issue.
