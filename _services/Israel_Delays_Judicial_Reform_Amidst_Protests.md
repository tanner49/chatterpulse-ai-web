# Israel Delays Judicial Reform Amidst Protests
### Prime Minister Netanyahu's Controversial Plan Sparks Nationwide Outrage
#### April 03, 2023

## Introduction
Israel has been rocked by some of the largest protests in its history over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposed judicial reforms. The far-right government's plan to weaken the country's court system has sparked widespread outrage, with critics saying it could spell the end of democracy in the world's only majority-Jewish country. On Monday, after a long day of protests, Netanyahu announced a delay to the judicial reform proposal, citing the need to prevent a civil war. 

## The Sides
Netanyahu's proposed legal reforms have been favored by partners in his far-right coalition government, but many fear they would spell the end of liberal democracy in Israel. The crisis in Israel has exposed a deep rift in the country's society, with some arguing that the proposed reforms are necessary to ensure the government's ability to govern effectively, while others see them as a blatant power grab that would undermine the country's democratic institutions. 

## What People Are Saying
- "Israel is being hit from all sides. It’s so deeply fractured from within." - Useful Idiots with Matt Taibbi and Katie Halper
- "The overwhelming popular response from Israeli citizens to push back against this 'reform,' with millions pouring out onto the streets over the last few weeks, culminating in the last 48 hours, where military personnel have joined citizens in protest." - The Majority Report with Sam Seder
- "Netanyahu moves to 'avoid civil war,' delays judicial overhaul plan amid strikes, protests." - The Dan Bongino Show
- "The far-right government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been pushing a highly contentious plan to fundamentally change the country’s Supreme Court." - The Daily
- "If adopted, the reforms could spell the end of democracy in the world’s only majority-Jewish country." - Today, Explained

The delay of the proposed reforms is seen as a victory for the protesters, who have been calling for Netanyahu to back down. However, many are skeptical that the delay is anything more than a temporary measure, and fear that the government will continue to push for the reforms in the future. The crisis in Israel has raised thorny questions about the intertwined fates of two of the world's most important democracies, and has sparked a global conversation about the future of democracy in the 21st century.
