### Surprising Final Four Teams and Upsets

## Introduction
March Madness has taken over the sports world, with the NCAA Men's and Women's Basketball Tournaments in full swing. The Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight rounds have come and gone, leaving fans with a Final Four that nobody could have predicted. Upsets have been the norm, with blue blood programs falling to relative unknowns. The excitement and unpredictability of the tournament have captivated audiences across the country.

## The Buzz
The buzz surrounding the tournament is all about the unexpected Final Four teams. On the men's side, San Diego State, FAU, UCONN, and Miami have all punched their tickets to Houston. None of these teams were considered favorites to make it this far, but they have all played with heart and determination. On the women's side, South Carolina remains the favorite to win it all, but LSU, Virginia Tech, and Kennesaw State have all made surprising runs to the Final Four.
