# Trump Indictment: A Political Circus?
### Opinions fly as former President faces charges
#### April 10, 2023
## Introduction
In a week filled with drama and surreal moments, former President Donald Trump was indicted and arraigned on 34 counts of falsifying business records. As the first former president to be indicted, the case has sparked a flurry of opinions and debates across the podcast world. Some see the charges as a partisan witch-hunt, while others argue that it's a necessary step towards justice.

## The Sides
On one side, podcasts like "Talking Feds," "Mea Culpa," and "The Lawfare Podcast" discuss the significance of the indictment and its potential implications for the future. Others, such as "The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show" and "Mark Levin Podcast," argue that the charges are preposterous and politically motivated, with no real crimes or federal offenses being alleged.

## What People Are Saying
- "Donald Trump became the first former president to be indicted this past weekâ€”and he celebrated with a speech from his Mar-a-Lago estate that painted the charges against him as a partisan witch-hunt." - The Lawfare Podcast
- "Buck's theory on Democrats' timeline and strategy to hit Trump with multiple indictments in an election year." - The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show
- "There must be an underlying crime that is being covered up by a bookkeeping error to make it a felony rather than a misdemeanor, and Trump has been charged with no underlying crimes." - Mark Levin Podcast
- "The Trump indictment is a dangerous leap on the highest of wires." - Slate News, quoting Ruth Marcus for The Washington Post
- "Eliza Orlins joins the show to discuss her recent piece on why the Trump indictment is bad for US democracy." - Breaking Points with Krystal and Saagar

As the case unfolds, it's clear that opinions will continue to be divided. But one thing is certain: the Trump indictment has turned the political world into a circus, and everyone is grabbing their popcorn.
