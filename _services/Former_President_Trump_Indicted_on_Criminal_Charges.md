# Former President Trump Indicted on Criminal Charges
### Manhattan Grand Jury Votes to Indict Trump on Hush Money Case
#### April 01, 2023

## Introduction
Former President Donald Trump has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury on criminal charges related to hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. This marks the first time in American history that a former president has faced criminal charges. Trump is expected to appear at his arraignment on Tuesday, and his Republican allies are rallying around him, with Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene even announcing she will go to New York to protest the indictment. Meanwhile, veteran prosecutors are discussing the strategies they might use to build their case against Trump.

## The Sides
On one side, supporters of Trump are claiming that the charges against him are politically motivated, and that the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is a radical, racist prosecutor who is out to get Trump. They argue that the hush money payments were a private matter between Trump and Daniels, and that they do not constitute a crime. On the other side, legal experts are pointing out that the payments were made to influence the outcome of the election, and that they violate campaign finance laws. They argue that Trump is not above the law, and that he must be held accountable for his actions.

## What People Are Saying
- "The witch hunt against Trump hits a new low." - The Dan Bongino Show
- "This indictment, regarding a hush-money payment, is the first time a former president has been charged with a crime." - The Glenn Beck Program
- "Charging a former president with a crime will be the ultimate test of our legal and political systems." - Post Reports
- "The libs make history by indicting Donald Trump on the very same day that they stage their own insurrection at the Tennessee State Capitol, because irony is dead." - The Michael Knowles Show
- "What is DA Alvin Braggâ€™s real motive behind prosecuting the former President?" - The Liz Wheeler Show

It remains to be seen how the case against Trump will play out, but one thing is clear: the indictment of a former president is a historic moment that will have far-reaching implications for American politics and the rule of law.
