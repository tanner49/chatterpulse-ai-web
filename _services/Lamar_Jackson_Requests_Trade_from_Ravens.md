# Lamar Jackson Requests Trade from Ravens
### Former MVP QB stirs up controversy with trade request
#### March 31, 2023

## Introduction
Former MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson has requested a trade from the Baltimore Ravens, according to multiple sources. Jackson, who was franchise-tagged by the Ravens, has been in contract negotiations with the team for some time, but talks have reportedly stalled. The news of Jackson's trade request has sent shockwaves through the NFL, with many wondering where the star quarterback will end up next.

## The Sides
Some analysts believe that Jackson's trade request is a strategic move to put pressure on the Ravens to offer him a more lucrative contract. Others speculate that Jackson is genuinely unhappy with the team and is looking for a fresh start elsewhere. There are also those who believe that Jackson's recent Twitter outburst, in which he accused the Ravens of not valuing him, has damaged his reputation and hurt his chances of finding a new team.
