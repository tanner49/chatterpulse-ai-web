# Former President Trump Indicted by Manhattan Grand Jury
### Trump becomes first former president to face criminal charges
#### March 31, 2023

## Introduction
Former President Donald Trump has been indicted by a Manhattan Grand Jury on criminal charges related to hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. This marks the first time in U.S. history that a current or former president will face criminal charges. The indictment is said to be connected to payments made to Daniels in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election. Trump has called the indictment "political persecution and election interference at the highest level in history." 

## The Sides
There are two sides to this story. On one hand, supporters of Trump argue that the indictment is politically motivated and an attempt to silence the former president. They believe that the charges are baseless and that Trump is being unfairly targeted by the Manhattan district attorney’s office. On the other hand, those who support the indictment argue that no one is above the law, not even the president of the United States. They believe that Trump should be held accountable for his actions and that the indictment is a step towards justice.
