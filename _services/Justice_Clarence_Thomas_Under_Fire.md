# Justice Clarence Thomas Under Fire
### Ethics questions arise over undisclosed gifts and real estate deals
#### April 19, 2023
## Introduction
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is facing scrutiny over his failure to disclose gifts, real estate deals, and financial filings. Reports have surfaced that Thomas has been receiving undisclosed gifts from billionaire Republican donor Harlan Crow for decades, including luxury vacations and yacht outings. Additionally, Thomas has been accused of failing to disclose a real estate deal with Crow.

## The Sides
Critics argue that these undisclosed gifts and deals undermine public confidence in the judiciary and may violate ethics rules. Supporters of Thomas claim that he consulted with his colleagues at the beginning of his tenure on the court and believed he didn't need to report "personal hospitality from close personal friends."
