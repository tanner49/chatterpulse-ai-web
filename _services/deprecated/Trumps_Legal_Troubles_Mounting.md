# Trump's Legal Troubles Mounting
### Manhattan Grand Jury Investigation and Fulton County District Attorney's Consideration of Criminal Charges
#### March 28, 2023

Former President Donald Trump is facing mounting legal troubles as investigations into his actions while in office continue. The Manhattan grand jury investigation into the hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels could soon make Trump the first former American president ever to be criminally indicted. Additionally, the Fulton County district attorney in Georgia is considering criminal charges for Trump’s efforts to influence the 2020 election, and the Department of Justice is investigating his role in the Jan. 6 riots and the removal of classified documents from the White House.

Trump has a knack for forcing our legal and political systems into predicaments that don’t really have good solutions. How should a political system handle criminal charges against a current political candidate? Is it appropriate for prosecutors to consider the risk of mob violence in weighing charges? What’s the risk of damage to our institutions of holding Trump accountable — and for failing to do so?

This level of legal vulnerability surrounding a former president is unprecedented. On today’s episode of The MeidasTouch Podcast, we bring you the latest updates on the Manhattan criminal case regarding Donald Trump. We'll also discuss how Trump's lawyer Joe Tacopina incriminated his client during a series of live TV hits over the weekend, and new updates that provide clarity on Jack Smith's federal investigation into Trump.

## The Sides
The sides in this story are those who believe that Trump should be held accountable for his actions while in office and those who believe that the investigations are politically motivated and an attempt to undermine Trump's legacy. Mark Levin, on his podcast, called the Manhattan case against Donald Trump a disgusting politicization of the legal process. He also stated that Trump and his family have been dragged through multiple special counsels and Democrat witch hunts. On the other hand, The Ezra Klein Show and The MeidasTouch Podcast are reporting on the legal vulnerabilities surrounding a former president and the latest updates on the Manhattan criminal case regarding Donald Trump.
