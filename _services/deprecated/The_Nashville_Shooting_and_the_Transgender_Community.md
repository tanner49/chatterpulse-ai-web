# The Nashville Shooting and the Transgender Community
### A look at the aftermath of the Nashville school shooting and its impact on the transgender community
#### March 29, 2023

## Introduction
The Nashville school shooting, where a transgender person identified as Audrey Hale opened fire and killed six people, including three children, has sparked a heated debate about the transgender community. While some argue that the shooting is a result of the mental illness epidemic spreading throughout society, others blame the trans movement and queer theory for the tragedy. The incident has also led to discussions about the language used to describe the transgender community and the violence they face. 

## The Sides
On one side, some podcasts like The Liz Wheeler Show and Off The Bench with Heidi St. John argue that the trans movement and queer theory are to blame for the Nashville shooting. They claim that the movement is hell-bent on changing the language to fit their deceitful narrative and that queer theory is the ideological underpinning of the trans movement. 

On the other side, podcasts like The News & Why It Matters and The Young Turks argue that conservatives are blaming transgender hormone drugs for the Nashville shooting. They also criticize legacy media outlets for misidentifying the gender of the shooter and for not giving enough attention to the discrimination and violence faced by the transgender community.
