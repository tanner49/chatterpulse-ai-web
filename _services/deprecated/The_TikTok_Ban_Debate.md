# The TikTok Ban Debate
### Congress Grills TikTok CEO Over National Security Concerns
#### March 29, 2023

## Introduction
TikTok, the popular social media app, has been under scrutiny by the US government over concerns of national security. The app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has been accused of collecting user data and sharing it with the Chinese government. As a result, Congress has been debating whether to ban the app in the US. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified before Congress on Thursday, facing tough questions from lawmakers over the app's safety and its ties to China.

During the five-hour hearing, Chew defended the company's ownership and outlined its billion-dollar restructuring effort to build a firewall between its Chinese owner and the data of the app's 150 million US users. However, lawmakers remained skeptical and pressed Chew on the app's data security practices and its relationship with the Chinese government.

## The Sides
Those in favor of the ban argue that TikTok poses a national security threat and that the Chinese government could use the app to collect sensitive information on Americans. They also point to the fact that China has a history of using technology to spy on other countries.

On the other hand, opponents of the ban argue that it would be an infringement on free speech and that there is no evidence that TikTok has shared user data with the Chinese government. They also point out that other social media apps, such as Facebook and Twitter, collect user data as well.

## What People Are Saying
- "The attack on TikTok is really a distraction from our real threats." - The Michael Savage Show

Despite the debate, it remains unclear whether Congress will ultimately decide to ban TikTok in the US. The issue highlights the ongoing tension between the US and China over technology and national security.
