# Protests Erupt in Israel Over Judicial Overhaul Plan
### Netanyahu Delays Plan Amidst Widespread Demonstrations
#### March 29, 2023

## Introduction
Israel has been rocked by some of the largest protests in its history over a highly contentious plan to fundamentally change the country's Supreme Court. The far-right government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been pushing this plan, which has set off widespread demonstrations across the country. On Monday, Mr. Netanyahu announced that he would delay his government's campaign to overhaul the judiciary system until the next parliamentary session next month. The decision comes amid growing outrage over the reforms, which critics say undermine Israel's democracy.

## The Sides
The plan to overhaul the judiciary system has been a top priority for Netanyahu's far-right coalition government. Supporters of the plan argue that it will make the court more conservative and less activist, while opponents say it will undermine the independence of the judiciary and give the government too much power. The delay of the plan has been seen as a victory for the protesters, who have been calling for the government to abandon the plan altogether.

The delay of the plan has been seen as a victory for the protesters, who have been calling for the government to abandon the plan altogether. However, it remains to be seen whether the delay will be enough to satisfy the protesters, who have been calling for Netanyahu to resign. The situation in Israel is tense, and many are worried that the protests could lead to violence or even civil war.
