# Understanding God's Will
### Exploring the concept of God's will and how to navigate it
#### March 28, 2023

## Introduction
Understanding God's will can be a difficult concept to grasp. Many people struggle with the idea of how to navigate God's plan for their lives, especially when it seems like God is saying "no" to their desires. In podcasts such as "Off The Bench with Heidi St. John" and "Tony Evans' Sermons on Oneplace.com," hosts explore the idea of running from God and how to keep pushing forward when God says no. Other podcasts, such as "The Bible in a Year (with Fr. Mike Schmitz)" and "Renewing Your Mind with R.C. Sproul," delve into the idea of God's promises and how they are fulfilled, even in the midst of hardship and temptation.

## The Sides
When it comes to understanding God's will, there are different sides and opinions. Some believe that God's will is predetermined and that we have no control over it, while others believe that we have free will and can make choices that align with God's plan. In "The Catechism in a Year (with Fr. Mike Schmitz)," the concept of predestination is explored, and it is explained that God's plan includes each person's free will and response to His grace. However, in "Truth For Life Daily Program," the question is raised as to why not everyone recognizes Jesus as the promised Messiah and why God didn't deliver Jesus from the cross. These differing opinions show the complexity of understanding God's will.
