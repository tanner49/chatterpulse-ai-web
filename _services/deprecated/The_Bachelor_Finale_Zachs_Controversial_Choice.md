#### March 30, 2023

## Introduction
The Bachelor season 27 has come to a close, and fans are still buzzing about Zach Shallcross's controversial final rose pick. Despite a strong connection with Gabi Elnicki, Zach ultimately chose Kaity Biggar, leaving Gabi heartbroken and fans divided. The aftermath of the finale has been filled with drama, from Mike Fleiss leaving the franchise to Sean Lowe throwing Zach under the bus. Here's what people are saying about the finale and Zach's choice.

## The Sides
Fans are split on Zach's final choice, with some praising him for following his heart and others criticizing him for leading Gabi on. The Viall Files podcast discussed whether Zach should have told Ariel Frenkel what happened in Fantasy Suites, while Love to See It with Emma and Claire featured Gabi and Ariel criticizing Zach and the show as a whole. The Betchelor podcast had hot takes on how Zach handled Fantasy Suites, with Jared defending him and Kay breaking down the episodes couple by couple. Meanwhile, The Woody Show mistakenly recapped the Bachelorette finale instead of The Bachelor.

## What People Are Saying
- "Zach claiming that his final dates were aired out of order is just another example of the show's manipulation." - The Viall Files
- "I was surprised that Zach chose Kaity, but I respect him for following his heart." - Off The Vine with Kaitlyn Bristowe
- "Sean Lowe is spineless for throwing Zach under the bus during After The Final Rose." - The Betchelor
- "Gabi wore yellow to her almost proposal, and now I can't unsee it." - The Betchelor
- "Zach's questionable choices this past Monday night left me disappointed." - Reality Steve Podcast

Overall, Zach's final rose pick has sparked a lot of debate and discussion among Bachelor Nation. Only time will tell if he made the right choice, but one thing is for sure - fans will be eagerly awaiting the next season of the show.
