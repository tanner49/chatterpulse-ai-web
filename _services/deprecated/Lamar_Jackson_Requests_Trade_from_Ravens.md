### Former MVP QB wants out of Baltimore
#### March 29, 2023

Former MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson has requested a trade from the Baltimore Ravens.

Some reports suggest that Jackson is seeking a contract that would make him the highest-paid quarterback in the league, while the Ravens are hesitant to commit to such a deal. The Patriots have been mentioned as a potential landing spot for Jackson, with rumors swirling that they are interested in trading for him. However, other teams, such as the Colts and Panthers, have also been mentioned as potential suitors.
