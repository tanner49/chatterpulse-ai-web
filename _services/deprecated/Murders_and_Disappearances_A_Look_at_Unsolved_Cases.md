# Murders and Disappearances: A Look at Unsolved Cases
### A compilation of true crime stories
#### March 29, 2023

## Introduction
True crime stories have become increasingly popular in recent years, with podcasts and TV shows dedicated to exploring the details of unsolved cases. From kidnappings to murders, these stories often leave listeners with more questions than answers. In this article, we will take a look at a variety of true crime stories, each with its own unique set of circumstances.

In one case, a young boy named Adam was abducted from a shopping plaza in 1981, leading to a decades-long search for answers. In another, a woman named Lina Kaufman was found dead in her Florida home, with medical experts initially pointing to physical evidence of strangulation. And in yet another case, a man named Lonnie Paye was found dead in his garage after his girlfriend called the police when he didn't return her phone calls.

## The Sides
In many of these cases, there are multiple sides to the story. For example, in the case of Lonnie Paye, it is unclear who was responsible for his death. In the case of Lina Kaufman, her husband Adam was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, but his defense attorneys speculated about an allergic reaction to a spray tan. And in the case of Adam, the young boy who was abducted in 1981, there are still many unanswered questions about what happened to him.
