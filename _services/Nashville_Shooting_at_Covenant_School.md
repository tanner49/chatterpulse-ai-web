# Nashville Shooting at Covenant School
### Tragedy Strikes Again in America
#### April 03, 2023

## Introduction
Another mass shooting has occurred in America, this time at the Covenant School in Nashville. A young woman, who identified as a man, walked into the school and killed six people, including three children. The incident has sparked a national conversation about gun control and school safety. While some are calling for stricter gun laws, others are advocating for more armed security in schools. 

## The Sides
Those in favor of stricter gun laws argue that it is too easy for people to obtain firearms in America, leading to an increase in mass shootings. They believe that the government should take action to limit access to guns, especially assault weapons. On the other hand, those who support more armed security in schools argue that it is necessary to protect students and staff from potential threats. They believe that having trained professionals on site can prevent or minimize the damage of a mass shooting.
