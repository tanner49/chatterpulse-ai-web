# MLB's New Rule Changes: A Game Changer?
### The impact of MLB's new rule changes on the game and its viewers
#### April 01, 2023

## Introduction
Major League Baseball (MLB) has implemented some of the biggest changes in the sport's history to speed up the game and inject more activity. The new rules include a pitch clock, time-saving changes, and a limit on the number of mound visits. While some fans and players are excited about the changes, others are skeptical about their impact on the game. 

According to The Best One Yet podcast, MLB has 10 times as many games as the NFL, but half the revenue. The new rule changes aim to fix "The Boring Problem" and make the game more exciting for viewers. However, some fans and players are concerned that the changes will alter the game's essence and tradition.

## The Sides
MLB's new rule changes have sparked a debate among fans and players. Some believe that the changes will make the game more exciting and engaging for viewers, while others argue that they will alter the game's essence and tradition. 

On The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz, the hosts debated which sport has the best opening day, and on The Tony Kornheiser Show, they discussed how all the new rules worked on opening day. Meanwhile, on The Herd with Colin Cowherd, Colin explains how MLB's rule changes immediately paid off on opening day, and why he changed his tune about the WWE after seeing Wrestlemania in person.

On The Dan Patrick Show, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred joins the show to discuss the new rules for the 2023 season and the impacts they will have on the game moving forward. ESPN MLB Insider Jeff Passan also previews the season on this opening day and talks some hardball on Opening Day in Major League Baseball.
