# Nashville School Shooting: A Nation Divided
### Debates on gun control and school safety intensify after the tragic event
#### April 04, 2023

## Introduction
In the wake of the devastating Nashville Christian school massacre, which left six people dead, the nation is once again grappling with the issue of gun control and school safety. As emotions run high, opinions on the matter are as diverse as ever, with some calling for stricter gun control laws, while others advocate for increased security measures in schools.

## The Sides
On one side of the debate, proponents of stricter gun control argue that the recent tragedy highlights the urgent need for reform. They point to statistics showing that gun violence has surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of death for American children. Some even call for a nationwide education strike to demand gun reform, as seen in the student walkout that took place in Tennessee to protest gun violence.

On the other side, those advocating for increased school security measures argue that armed guards in schools could help prevent such tragedies. They question why every school isn't defended by a "badass" that potential killers would have to get through. Some even suggest that the cost of implementing armed security in every school in America would be worth it to protect children.
