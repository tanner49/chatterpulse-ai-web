# China's Military Drills and Taiwan Tensions: A Global Chess Game
### The world watches as tensions rise between China, Taiwan, and the United States
#### April 10, 2023
## Introduction
As China wraps up its military drills around Taiwan, the world is left to ponder the implications of these exercises and the escalating tensions between China, Taiwan, and the United States. High-level meetings between Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and US politicians, including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have further strained US-China relations, while discussions on China's growing influence in Africa and its domestic economic policies add fuel to the fire.

## The Sides
On one side, China's military drills and simulated strikes on Taiwan have raised concerns about the possibility of an invasion, with some experts warning that the US may be drawn into a war with China. On the other hand, there are those who argue that China's actions are merely posturing and that a non-hegemonic world is possible. Meanwhile, the US is attempting to counter China's growing influence in Africa, with Vice President Kamala Harris's recent visit sending a clear message: "China is not your friend. The United States is."

## What People Are Saying
