# Trump Indictment Watch Continues
### Grand Jury Delays and Legal Analysis
#### March 29, 2023

## Introduction
The suspense of the never-ending Trump Indictment Watch continues as the grand jury investigating former President Donald Trump's involvement in a 2016 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels has faced delays. The grand jury in the Manhattan DA case will not meet this week, and it is unclear when they will vote on a possible indictment. Meanwhile, Trump continues to attack prosecutors and the legal system, warning of "potential death and destruction" if he is indicted. Legal experts are weighing in on the strength of the potential criminal charges and Trump's possible defenses to the charges.

## The Sides
There are two sides to this story. On one hand, supporters of Trump argue that the Manhattan case against him is a disgusting politicization of the legal process. They claim that Trump and his family have been dragged through multiple special counsels and Democrat witch hunts. They also argue that there needs to be a thorough housecleaning in the Department of Justice, especially the FBI, because Trump is a victim of the Democrat system.

On the other hand, those who support the investigation argue that Trump's legal troubles are mounting, and he routinely flouts protocols and norms. They believe that the Manhattan grand jury investigation into the hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels could soon make Trump the first former American president ever to be criminally indicted. They also point out that Trump's warning of "potential death and destruction" if he is indicted is a dangerous and irresponsible statement that could incite violence.
