In a groundbreaking move, the Philadelphia Eagles have signed quarterback Jalen Hurts to a colossal 5-year, $255 million contract extension, making him the highest-paid player in NFL history. The deal includes $179.3 million in guarantees and a no-trade clause, a first for the franchise.

## The Buzz
The sports world is abuzz with reactions to Hurts' record-breaking contract.
