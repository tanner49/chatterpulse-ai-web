# Nashville School Shooting Leaves Six Dead
### Police Release Details on Shooter and Gun Purchases
#### March 30, 2023

## Introduction
On Monday, a shooter entered the Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee, killing three children and three adults. The shooter, who was later killed by police, had purchased seven guns legally and was under care for an emotional disorder. The incident has reignited the debate on gun control and school safety measures.

Police have released body-camera footage from the two officers who fatally shot the attacker. The footage shows the officers responding quickly and heroically to the situation, taking down the shooter in just six minutes.

## The Sides
Gun control advocates are calling for stricter laws to prevent individuals with emotional disorders from purchasing firearms. They argue that the shooter's history of mental illness should have prevented him from obtaining the weapons used in the attack. Others, however, argue that the focus should be on improving school safety measures, such as increasing the number of armed guards and implementing metal detectors.

Some are also calling for a hate crime investigation, as the shooter's parents claim that he had a vendetta against Christians. However, others argue that the motive is still unclear and that jumping to conclusions could be harmful.

## What People Are Saying
- "The 1994 Federal Assault Weapons ban had virtually no impact on murders, but President Biden and his Democrat mouthpieces know that the vast majority of murders are not committed by what they call assault weapons." - Mark Levin Podcast
- "The shooter in Nashville purchased 7 guns, including multiple assault rifles, from 5 different stores across Tennessee, and loaded up on tons of ammunition." - The Breakdown with Shaun King
