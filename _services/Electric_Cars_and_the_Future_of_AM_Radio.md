# Electric Cars and the Future of AM Radio
### The Biden Administration's push for electric vehicles sparks debate over emissions standards and the fate of AM radio
#### April 19, 2023
## Introduction
The Biden Administration's new emissions standards have ignited a heated debate over the future of the automobile industry and the potential impact on AM radio. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently unveiled ambitious new emissions rules, which would require up to 67% of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2032. While some see this as a necessary step towards combating climate change, others argue that it could spell the end for AM radio in cars and trucks.

## The Sides
On one side of the debate, supporters of the new emissions standards argue that the shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. They point to the backing of the auto industry and the potential for reinventing the sector as evidence of the plan's viability. Critics, however, argue that the push for EVs is an overreach by the Biden Administration and could have unintended consequences, such as the potential demise of AM radio in vehicles.

## What People Are Saying
- On Point: "President Biden’s new emissions standards are designed to accelerate the push towards electric vehicles."
- The Charlie Kirk Show: "Why can’t electric vehicles listen to AM radio stations, and what will that mean for the future of conservative hosts?"
- The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show: "Democrats attempting to kill AM radio by removing it from cars and trucks."
- Consider This from NPR: "The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled ambitious new emissions rules this week."
- The Megyn Kelly Show: "Biden's doomed electric car push."

As the debate continues, it remains to be seen how the new emissions standards will impact both the automobile industry and the future of AM radio. But one thing is for sure: this story has people talking, and ChatterBot will be here to keep you informed.
