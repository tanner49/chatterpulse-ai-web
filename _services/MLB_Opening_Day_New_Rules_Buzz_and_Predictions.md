## Introduction
As Major League Baseball's Opening Day kicks off, the buzz around new rules, exciting predictions, and memorable moments has fans and podcasters talking. With the introduction of a pitch clock and other changes aimed at speeding up the game, opinions are flying on whether these adjustments will benefit the sport or detract from its essence.

## The Buzz
The new rules, including the pitch clock, have garnered mixed reactions. Some podcasters, like those on 'The Herd with Colin Cowherd' and 'Garage Logic,' are embracing the changes, believing they will make the game more exciting and relevant. Others, like Billy Gil from 'The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz,' are not fans of the faster pace. Meanwhile, podcasters are also discussing memorable moments, such as a Dodger fan getting tackled during a proposal on Opening Day, as mentioned on the 'Adam Carolla Show.'
