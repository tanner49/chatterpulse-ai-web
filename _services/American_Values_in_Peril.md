# American Values in Peril
### A new poll shows a decline in patriotism, religion, and other essential values
#### April 01, 2023

## Introduction
A recent poll conducted by the Wall Street Journal and NORC has revealed a decline in American values such as patriotism, religion, and hard work. The poll has sparked a debate about the state of the nation and what it means for the future of America.

According to the poll, only 39% of Americans consider themselves "very patriotic," down from 70% in 2003. The poll also found that fewer Americans attend religious services, with only 36% saying they attend weekly, down from 50% in 2003. Additionally, the poll found that fewer Americans believe in the value of hard work, with only 50% saying that working hard is "very important," down from 62% in 2003.

## The Sides
Some commentators have blamed the decline in American values on the political polarization and tribalism that has taken hold in the country. Others have pointed to the erosion of traditional institutions such as the family, the church, and the community as a cause of the decline. Still, others have argued that the decline in American values is a result of the failure of political leaders to inspire and unite the country.

## What People Are Saying

The decline in American values is a cause for concern for many Americans. While some blame political polarization and tribalism, others point to the erosion of traditional institutions. Regardless of the cause, it is clear that the country needs to come together to address this issue and find a way to restore the values that have made America great.
