The NBA playoffs are just around the corner, and teams are fighting tooth and nail to secure their positions. The Western Conference is particularly tight, with several teams vying for the top spot. Meanwhile, the Eastern Conference is shaping up to be a battle between the Bucks and the Celtics. Let's take a look at what the experts are saying.

## The Sides
The experts are split on who will come out on top in the playoffs. Some believe that the Lakers, with their strong free throw game, have a good chance of making a run. Others think that the Suns are the team to beat in the West. In the East, opinions are divided between the Bucks and the Celtics, with some even suggesting that Tatum is on the same tier as Giannis.
