# The Opioid Epidemic: A Battle on Multiple Fronts
### From Overdose Deaths to Over-the-Counter Narcan, the Fight Continues
#### April 05, 2023
## Introduction
The opioid epidemic continues to ravage the United States, with overdose deaths reaching staggering numbers. As the crisis unfolds, various approaches are being taken to combat the issue, from making life-saving medications more accessible to addressing the role of Big Pharma and Big Ag in the problem.

## The Sides
On one side, the FDA has approved over-the-counter sales of Narcan, a nasal spray version of the life-saving medication naloxone, known for its ability to rapidly reverse an opioid overdose. This move is seen as a step in the right direction for preventing overdose deaths. However, concerns about the price and stigma surrounding Narcan remain obstacles to its widespread use.

On the other side, there are concerns about the influence of Big Pharma and Big Ag in the opioid crisis, with some warning that these industries are working together to place mRNA and other genetic modifications into our food. Additionally, the rise of "smart pills" has raised questions about the balance between patient health and privacy.

## What People Are Saying
- "Many of the overdose deaths are not drug addicts." - Sara Carter Show
- "The most recent number of overdose deaths in just one year was well above the numbers of American deaths in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined." - Sara Carter Show
- "The FDA's move will make Narcan more widely available than ever before." - Consider This from NPR
- "How the drug industry uses fear of fentanyl to extract more profit from naloxone." - The Daily Zeitgeist
- "Are smart pills a new way to keep patients healthy longer, or another step in the construction of a biomedical Big Brother?" - Stuff They Don't Want You To Know

As the opioid epidemic continues to evolve, the battle against it is being fought on multiple fronts. From increasing access to life-saving medications to addressing the role of powerful industries in the crisis, the fight to save lives and curb addiction is far from over.
