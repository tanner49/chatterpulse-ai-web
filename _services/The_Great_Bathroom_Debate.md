# The Great Bathroom Debate
### From boogers to toilets, the latest on bathroom etiquette
#### April 03, 2023

## Introduction
Bathrooms are a necessary part of life, but they can also be a source of controversy. From the proper way to wipe to the best stall to choose, everyone seems to have an opinion. In this article, we'll explore the latest in bathroom etiquette and the ongoing debate over what's right and what's wrong.

## The Sides
On one side of the debate are those who believe in strict bathroom rules. They argue that there is a right way to do everything, from wiping to washing your hands. They believe that bathrooms should be clean and orderly, and that everyone should follow the same set of rules.

On the other side are those who believe in more relaxed bathroom etiquette. They argue that everyone has their own way of doing things, and that as long as you're not hurting anyone else, you should be free to do what you want. They believe that bathrooms should be a place of individual expression, not conformity.
