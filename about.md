One of the biggest challenges in market research and consumer insights is capturing accurate and insightful data about potential customers. Although there are many options for capturing data, three primary data sources dominate the space: (a) sales and economic data, (b) survey and interview data, and (c) data scraped from the internet. 

Each of these data sources has severe and growing limitations. As many markets consolidate, open sales and economic data becomes equally opaque, and economic data is always by definition backwards-facing. Individuals are much less likely to be willing to participate in surveys than in previous decades, and responses are becoming increasingly biased due to non-responders. Even when successful, (and legal) scrapes from social media sites are increasingly biased by the opaque algorithms that drive these sites.

## Why Podcasts?

 Podcasts are a unique form of media, consumed by 32% of Americans (and more and more every day). Podcasts offer several advantages over traditional market research:
- Unlike social media, the conversations on podcasts are nuanced, long form, and diverse. -
- The openly available popularity metrics for podcasts allow us to see the relative weight and influence of different opinions around topics, circumventing the sampling bias of survey market research. 
- Podcasts are, unlike sales and economic data, forward-facing, not dated. 
- Podcasts are run by thought leaders who set trends around broad and niche topics in markets and society. 

If an organization had the ability to consume and comprehend all podcasts related to their product or market, they would be at a substantial competitive advantage. Chatter Pulse AI enables exactly this!
