# Media Mayhem: Trust in News Outlets Plummets
### The Great Divide in American Media Landscape
#### April 05, 2023
## Introduction
In a world where trust in media is at an all-time low, the American media landscape is facing a crisis. With accusations of bias, hypocrisy, and complacency, the divide between different news outlets and their audiences is growing wider. This report dives into the current state of the media, the various opinions surrounding it, and the potential consequences of this great divide.

## The Sides
On one side, there are those who believe that the mainstream media has become too cozy with power, abandoning its principles and losing the trust of the people. They argue that the media is no longer trusted, with only 36 percent of Americans saying they have either a "great deal" or even a "fair amount" of trust in the media, according to Newt's World. Critics also claim that the media is biased, with the Mark Levin Podcast stating that the American Pravda media supports Democrats and acts as attack dogs to Republicans and anyone who dares to support Trump.

On the other side, there are those who argue that the biggest problem in media is the audience, as not everything is a conspiracy. They believe that the media industry is not beyond repair, but it must return to presenting the public with facts in a dispassionate and neutral manner, as suggested by John Solomon Reports.

## What People Are Saying
- "There is no opposition media left in America, they now carry water for the people in power." - The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show
- "The mainstream media's relief as Donald Trump dominates the limelight and makes journalists' jobs easier is discussed." - Stu Does America
- "The biggest problem in media is the audience: Not everything is a conspiracy." - Slate News, quoting a tweet from @george_mack
- "Americaâ€™s corporate news media is less trusted than ever." - Newt's World
- "Is the media industry beyond repair?" - The Gray Area with Sean Illing

As the battle for trust in media continues, it remains to be seen whether the industry can find a way to bridge the divide and regain the confidence of the American people. Until then, the media mayhem rages on.
