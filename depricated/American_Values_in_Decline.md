# American Values in Decline
### A new poll reveals a decline in patriotism, religion, and hard work in America
#### March 30, 2023

## Introduction
A recent poll conducted by the Wall Street Journal and NORC has found that several values that once defined America, including patriotism, religion, and hard work, are receding in importance to Americans. The decline in these values has been a topic of discussion across various political podcasts, with some attributing it to the rise of authoritarianism and the failure of politicians to address the issues that matter to their constituents.

## The Sides
Conservative podcasts like The Rubin Report and Mark Levin Podcast have criticized the Democratic solution to policies that don't work, which they claim is always more government, centralization, redistribution, and interference with liberty. They also argue that there is a Marxist movement customized towards democracies and the Republic, and that America is currently in a soft tyranny. On the other hand, liberal podcasts like The Weeds and Today, Explained have discussed the government's plan for overhaul and what it means for those whose lives are on the line. They argue that the decline in values is a result of systemic issues that need to be addressed through policy changes.

## What People Are Saying

- "The decline in patriotism is a result of the government's failure to address the issues that matter to Americans." - The Weeds
- "The decline in values is a result of the rise of authoritarianism in America." - Bannon's War Room

It is clear that the decline in American values is a topic of concern across the political spectrum. While there may be disagreement on the root causes of this decline, it is important for politicians to address these issues and work towards restoring the values that once defined America.
