# Lamar Jackson Requests Trade from Ravens
### Former MVP QB wants out of Baltimore
#### April 03, 2023

## Introduction
Former MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson has requested a trade from the Baltimore Ravens. Jackson, who was franchise-tagged by the Ravens, has been unable to reach a long-term deal with the team. The news broke on March 2nd when Jackson posted on Twitter that he had requested a trade. Since then, there has been much speculation about where he could end up and why he wants out of Baltimore.

## The Sides
Some analysts believe that Jackson's contract demands are too high, and that is why the Ravens have been hesitant to sign him to a long-term deal. Others believe that Jackson is worth every penny and that the Ravens should do whatever it takes to keep him. There are also those who think that Jackson's trade request is a strategic move to get the Ravens to pay him what he's worth.

- "As it relates to his contract negotiation, God is not directing Lamarâ€™s steps. Deshaun Watson is." - Fearless with Jason Whitlock
