# The Debate Over TikTok Ban
### Congress Grills TikTok CEO Over National Security Concerns
#### March 30, 2023

## Introduction
The debate over whether to ban TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media app, has been raging for years. On Thursday, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified before Congress for more than five hours, facing tough questions about the app's data security practices and its relationship with the Chinese government. The hearing comes as lawmakers consider a bill that would ban TikTok in the United States, citing concerns over national security and the app's potential to be used for Chinese government propaganda.

## The Sides
Those in favor of a TikTok ban argue that the app poses a significant national security threat, as it collects vast amounts of data on its users and is owned by a Chinese company with close ties to the Chinese government. They also point to evidence that the Chinese government has used TikTok to spread propaganda and manipulate content on the app.

Opponents of a TikTok ban argue that it would be an infringement on free speech and would set a dangerous precedent for government censorship of social media. They also point out that TikTok has taken steps to address concerns over data security and has proposed a plan, called Project Texas, to address U.S. security and privacy concerns.

## What People Are Saying
- "The proposed 'Restrict Act' would give the federal government complete control over anything deemed a security threat, essentially making it an enhanced Patriot Act." - The Glenn Beck Program
- "Does China manipulate TikTok algorithms to push ideologies that weaken the U.S., while restricting those very same ideologies in its own country? We explain why it's naive to think the answer is no." - Relatable with Allie Beth Stuckey
- "TikTok is being used to micro-target the American population." - Bannon's War Room
- "A TikTok ban would be an infringement on free speech and would set a dangerous precedent for government censorship of social media." - Opponents of a TikTok ban
- "TikTok collects vast amounts of data on its users and is owned by a Chinese company with close ties to the Chinese government." - Those in favor of a TikTok ban

The debate over whether to ban TikTok in the United States is far from over, with lawmakers on both sides of the issue continuing to push their agendas. As the battle rages on, the fate of the popular social media app remains uncertain.
