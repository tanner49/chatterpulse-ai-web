# Wisconsin Supreme Court Race Takes Center Stage
### A high-stakes election with national implications
#### April 05, 2023
## Introduction
In a precedent-shattering election, the race for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court has become the most important American election of 2023. With implications for abortion rights, electoral geography, and potentially the fate of the 2024 presidential election, this race has broken national spending records and garnered attention from both sides of the political spectrum.

## The Sides
The race is seen as a proxy battle between Republicans and Democrats in the state. Conservative Justice Daniel Kelly faces a tough challenge from liberal-backed Jill Karofsky. The winner could be the key swing vote on cases deciding everything from abortion rights to redistricting in the state.
