# The Debate Over Gun Control in America
### A look at the different opinions on gun control in the wake of the Nashville school shooting
#### March 31, 2023

## Introduction
The recent school shooting in Nashville has reignited the debate over gun control in America. While some argue that stricter gun laws are necessary to prevent such tragedies, others believe that the solution lies in arming teachers and increasing security measures in schools. 

According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have already been 130 mass shootings in 2023. President Biden has renewed his calls on Congress to ban assault weapons, while some Republicans argue that such a ban would not be effective in reducing gun violence. 

## The Sides
Those in favor of stricter gun laws argue that it is too easy for individuals to obtain firearms, and that this contributes to the high rates of gun violence in America. They believe that measures such as background checks, waiting periods, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines are necessary to prevent mass shootings. 

On the other hand, proponents of arming teachers and increasing security measures in schools argue that this would deter potential shooters and allow for a quicker response in the event of an attack. They also argue that gun-free zones make schools more vulnerable to attacks, and that allowing teachers to carry firearms would make schools safer.

It is clear that the debate over gun control in America is far from over. While some believe that stricter gun laws are necessary to prevent mass shootings, others argue that arming teachers and increasing security measures in schools is the solution. As the country continues to grapple with the issue of gun violence, it remains to be seen what actions will be taken to prevent future tragedies.
