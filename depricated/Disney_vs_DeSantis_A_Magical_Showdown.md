# Disney vs. DeSantis: A Magical Showdown
### The battle between the House of Mouse and Florida's Governor takes center stage
#### April 05, 2023
## Introduction
In a clash of titans that could rival any superhero movie, Disney and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are locked in a heated battle over control of the Reedy Creek Improvement District. As the drama unfolds, podcasts from all corners of the internet are chiming in with their takes on the situation, providing a colorful and entertaining look at this high-stakes game of chess.

## The Sides
On one side, we have Governor DeSantis, who recently signed a bill to take over Disney World's special district, as reported by The Daily Zeitgeist. However, Disney seems to have outmaneuvered the governor, with The Daily Beans describing the situation as Disney "checkmating" DeSantis. The legal struggles between the two parties are being analyzed by podcasts like #SistersInLaw and Opening Arguments, with the latter referring to DeSantis as a "dumpy Trump knockoff."

On the other side, we have Disney, which has been making headlines for a variety of reasons. From laying off staff as part of a cost-saving scheme (Up First) to ditching the metaverse (Grumpy Old Geeks), the House of Mouse is certainly keeping things interesting. Amidst the chaos, Disney CEO Bob Iger is also facing off against DeSantis, as mentioned on The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show.
