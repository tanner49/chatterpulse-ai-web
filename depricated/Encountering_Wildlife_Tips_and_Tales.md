# Encountering Wildlife: Tips and Tales
### From observing reptiles to encountering bears, podcasts share stories and advice
#### March 29, 2023

## Introduction
Encountering wildlife can be a thrilling experience, but it can also be dangerous. From the Art of Manliness to Against the Odds, podcasts have been sharing stories and tips on how to safely and ethically observe wild animals. Some podcasts also delve into the specifics of figuring out deer movement or the best places to spot wildlife. However, not all encounters are positive, as some podcasts discuss the dangers of bear attacks or the killing of a pet zebra.

When it comes to encountering wildlife, there are different opinions on how to approach it. The Art of Manliness suggests practicing "spontaneous acceptance" to chill with a beaver, while also providing tips on how to approach animals without making them feel uncomfortable. Against the Odds, on the other hand, shares stories of dangerous bear encounters and what to do if attacked. Wired To Hunt Podcast dives into the specifics of figuring out deer movement on individual properties, while The MeatEater Podcast discusses South Carolina's coyote harvest incentive program.
