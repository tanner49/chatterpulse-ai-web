# The Significance of Jesus' Death and Resurrection
### Exploring the Importance of Christ's Crucifixion and Resurrection
#### April 01, 2023

## Introduction
The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of the Christian faith. It is a story that has been told for centuries and has been the subject of countless sermons, books, and podcasts. The story of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection is a powerful one that has the ability to transform lives. It is a story of sacrifice, love, and redemption. 

According to the Truth For Life Daily Program, after Christ’s crucifixion, His disciples hid and huddled in fear. But within weeks, these same men boldly proclaimed that Jesus was the resurrected Messiah. The Bible in a Year (with Fr. Mike Schmitz) highlights the role of kinsman-redeemer in Ruth and how Jesus is the ultimate fulfillment of that role. Fr. Mike talks about Gideon's story in Judges and how the people began to worship the object Gideon had created to glorify God, instead of worshipping the living God. 

## The Sides
The significance of Jesus' death and resurrection is a topic that has been debated for centuries. Some argue that it is the most important event in human history, while others believe that it is simply a myth. The Catechism in a Year (with Fr. Mike Schmitz) makes it clear to us that Jesus did not come to save only the righteous who happened to be alive during his time here on earth, but he came to save all those righteous men and women who came before him and would come after him. The Fr. Mike Schmitz Catholic Podcast shows why God chose the Jewish people to make manifest his glory.
