# Former President Trump Indicted on Multiple Charges
### Trump prepares for arraignment in New York City
#### April 03, 2023

## Introduction
Former President Donald Trump is facing more than 30 criminal counts and is set to be arraigned in New York City on Tuesday. The charges include obstruction of justice, falsifying business records, and paying hush money to a porn star during the 2016 presidential campaign. Some Republicans are claiming that the indictment is politically motivated, while others are preparing for a legal battle.

## The Sides
Some Republicans are claiming that the indictment is politically motivated and that the charges are baseless. They argue that the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is a Democrat who is trying to take down a political opponent. Others believe that the charges are legitimate and that Trump should be held accountable for his actions.

## What People Are Saying
- "If you look at the plea deals Alvin Bragg has arranged, it's clear that the charges against President Trump are obviously political." - The Sean Hannity Show
- "This investigation is one of many the former president is facing." - Apple News Today
- "Former President Donald Trump is expected to surrender for his arraignment in New York tomorrow." - In the Bubble with Andy Slavitt
- "I think that banana republics are getting a bad rap right now. If you want to know what really makes a banana republic, it's not going and prosecuting a former President. It's allowing certain people to live above the law." - The Political Scene | The New Yorker
- "The Manhattan case against Donald Trump is a disgusting politicization of the legal process." - Mark Levin Podcast

It remains to be seen how the legal battle will play out, but one thing is for sure: the indictment of a former president is an unprecedented event in American history.
