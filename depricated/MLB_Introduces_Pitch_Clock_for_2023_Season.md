# MLB Introduces Pitch Clock for 2023 Season
### Will the new rule change make baseball more exciting or alienate traditional fans?
#### March 30, 2023

## Introduction
Major League Baseball has introduced a new rule change for the 2023 season: the pitch clock. The goal of the pitch clock is to speed up the game and appeal to younger audiences by requiring pitchers and batters to move more quickly. However, the effectiveness of the pitch clock in bringing in new fans is uncertain, and some traditional fans worry that the change will alienate them. Reporter Chelsea Janes joins Post Reports to explain what the pitch clock is and how it will impact the game. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred also joins The Dan Patrick Show to discuss the new rules for the 2023 season and the impacts they will have on the game moving forward.

## The Sides
The introduction of the pitch clock has sparked debate among baseball fans. Some believe that the new rule will make the game more exciting and engaging for younger audiences, while others worry that it will take away from the traditional pace of the game and alienate long-time fans. The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz discusses the potential benefits and drawbacks of the pitch clock, while First Take features a panel of experts who discuss their World Series predictions and whether or not we should be concerned about the Dodgers. The Herd with Colin Cowherd also debates whether or not baseball's popularity will benefit from the new rules.
