# Israel's Judicial Overhaul: On Hold, But Protests Continue
### Netanyahu delays controversial reforms, but citizens still take to the streets
#### April 04, 2023

## Introduction
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has delayed the planned overhaul of the country's judicial system, which has been subject to months-long demonstrations and general strikes. Despite the postponement, tens of thousands of citizens continue to protest, fearing a quiet slide from democracy.

## The Sides
On one side, Netanyahu's party is in talks with the opposition, hoping to reach a compromise. The move to suspend the legislation comes after Netanyahu fired Israel's head defense official, Yoav Gallant, for advocating against the legislation. On the other side, citizens and international observers express concerns about the weakening of Israel's supreme court and the potential erosion of democracy.
