# Protests Erupt in Israel Over Proposed Judicial Reforms
### Netanyahu Delays Controversial Plan Amid Strikes and Demonstrations
#### March 31, 2023

## Introduction
Israel has been rocked by some of the largest protests in its history over the past few weeks, as citizens take to the streets to voice their opposition to a proposed overhaul of the country's judiciary. The far-right government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been pushing for the reforms, which many fear would spell the end of liberal democracy in the state of Israel. However, after weeks of strikes and demonstrations, Netanyahu announced on Monday that he would delay his government's campaign.

## The Sides
On one side of the issue are those who support the proposed reforms, arguing that they are necessary to ensure that the judiciary is more closely aligned with the government's conservative agenda. On the other side are those who believe that the reforms would undermine the independence of the judiciary and threaten the very foundations of Israeli democracy.

## What People Are Saying

- "The current political situation in Israel is similar to what is happening in America and will only get worse." - Mark Levin Podcast

It remains to be seen what the future holds for Israel's judiciary and its democracy, but for now, the protests have succeeded in delaying the proposed reforms and drawing attention to the issue on a global scale.
