# Wisconsin and Chicago Elections Shake Things Up
### Liberals take control of Wisconsin Supreme Court, while Chicago elects a progressive mayor
#### April 10, 2023
## Introduction
In a series of recent elections, liberals have gained control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court for the first time in 15 years, while Chicago has elected a progressive mayor. These results have sparked a buzz in the political world, with some seeing them as a sign of things to come in the 2024 elections.

## The Buzz
The elections of Janet Protasiewicz to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and Brandon Johnson for Chicago mayor have caused quite a stir. With liberals now controlling the Wisconsin Supreme Court, some believe this could lead to the end of the state's abortion ban. Meanwhile, Chicago's new mayor, Brandon Johnson, is seen as a "progressive dream" candidate.

## What People Are Saying
- "Liberals retaking the Wisconsin Supreme Court will likely end the state’s abortion ban." - *The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell*
- "Chicago electing a 'progressive dream' candidate as mayor." - *The Megyn Kelly Show*
- "Chicago elected a Marxist as mayor, while Wisconsin now has a left-wing majority on its Supreme Court, making the state far harder to win in 2024." - *The Charlie Kirk Show*
- "The people of Chicago threw Lori Lightfoot out and have chosen to replace her with someone who is even worse." - *The Matt Walsh Show*
- "A George Soros-backed liberal Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate, Janet Protasiewicz, soundly defeated conservative-backed candidate Dan Kelly on Tuesday in a race that was crucial to the ideological balance of the court." - *The News & Why It Matters*

These election results have left many wondering what the future holds for both Wisconsin and Chicago, as well as the potential impact on the 2024 elections. As the political landscape continues to shift, all eyes will be on these key players and the decisions they make in their new roles.
