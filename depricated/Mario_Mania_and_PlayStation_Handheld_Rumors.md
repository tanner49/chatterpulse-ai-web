# Mario Mania and PlayStation Handheld Rumors
### Gaming world abuzz with Super Mario Bros. movie success and potential new Sony handheld device
#### April 10, 2023
## Introduction
The gaming world is buzzing with excitement as the Super Mario Bros. movie smashes box office records and rumors of a new Sony handheld device circulate. The movie, starring Chris Pratt and Charlie Day as Mario and Luigi, has been praised for its Easter eggs and nods to Nintendo's long history of video games. Meanwhile, speculation about a new PlayStation handheld, codenamed Q-Lite, has gamers wondering if it could be the next big thing in remote play.

## The Buzz
The Super Mario Bros. movie has taken the world by storm, with fans and critics alike praising its entertaining adaptation of the beloved video game franchise. The film follows Mario and Luigi, two New York City plumbers, as they team up with Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) to stop Bowser (Jack Black) from destroying the Mushroom Kingdom. The movie's success has even sparked discussions about potential animated adaptations and casting for a Donkey Kong movie.

On the other side of the gaming world, rumors of a new Sony handheld device have gamers intrigued. The device, reportedly codenamed Q-Lite, is said to be a DualSense controller with an 8-inch screen attached, designed for high-quality local remote play. However, with PSVR2 production reportedly cut by 20%, some are questioning if this new device could be a distraction from Sony's main goal of producing top-quality AAA games.
