# NFL Draft 2023: Speculations and Predictions
### Experts predict four quarterbacks to be drafted in the first four picks
#### April 03, 2023

## Introduction
The NFL Draft 2023 is just around the corner, and the excitement among football fans is palpable. With the draft being held in Las Vegas this year, the stakes are higher than ever. Experts and analysts have been busy speculating and predicting how the draft will play out, and the predictions are nothing short of intriguing. According to the podcasts, the first four picks of the draft are expected to be quarterbacks, which is a rare occurrence in the history of the NFL. 

## The Sides
While some experts believe that the first four picks being quarterbacks is a sign of the changing times and the increasing importance of the position, others argue that it is a risky move for teams to put all their eggs in one basket. They believe that teams should focus on building a strong foundation with a solid offensive line and a strong defense, rather than relying solely on a quarterback to carry the team.
