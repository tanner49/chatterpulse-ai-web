# Lamar Jackson Requests Trade from Baltimore Ravens
### The reigning MVP quarterback is seeking a new team
#### March 30, 2023

## Introduction
Lamar Jackson, the star quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens, has requested a trade from the team. Jackson, who won the NFL MVP award in 2019, has been in contract negotiations with the Ravens for several months, but the two sides have been unable to come to an agreement. Jackson's contract is set to expire at the end of the 2023 season, and he is seeking a long-term deal that would make him one of the highest-paid players in the league. The Ravens, however, have been hesitant to meet his demands, leading to Jackson's decision to request a trade.

## The Sides
Some analysts believe that Jackson is justified in seeking a new team, arguing that he has outperformed his current contract and deserves to be paid accordingly. Others, however, believe that Jackson's demands are unreasonable and that he should be more willing to compromise with the Ravens. Some have even suggested that Jackson's decision to go public with his trade request on social media was unprofessional and could hurt his reputation in the league.

## What People Are Saying
- "Lamar Jackson stands at a critical career crossroads. His desire to land a Deshaun Watson-type contract and the media-driven drumbeat of victimization have distracted him from the narrow path of football immortality he claims to prioritize." - Fearless with Jason Whitlock
- "As it relates to his contract negotiation, God is not directing Lamar’s steps. Deshaun Watson is." - Fearless with Jason Whitlock
- "The Lamar Jackson negotiations have become a joke and Brady has inside knowledge about his 'rep.'" - 2 Pros and a Cup of Joe
- "Lamar Jackson has demanded a trade from the Baltimore Ravens, painting himself as a victim after claiming that the team isn’t willing to meet his value." - Fearless with Jason Whitlock
- "Is it time for Lamar Jackson to finally hire an agent?" - Skip and Shannon: Undisputed

It remains to be seen which team, if any, will be willing to meet Jackson's demands and acquire him in a trade. Some potential landing spots that have been discussed include the New England Patriots, the Indianapolis Colts, and the Washington Football Team. Regardless of where he ends up, however, it is clear that Jackson's contract negotiations will continue to be a major storyline in the NFL for the foreseeable future.
