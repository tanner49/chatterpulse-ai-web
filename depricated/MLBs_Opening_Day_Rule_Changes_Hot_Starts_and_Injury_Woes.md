## Introduction
Major League Baseball's Opening Day has come and gone, and with it, a slew of new rule changes aimed at speeding up the game. While some fans and players have expressed skepticism about the changes, others believe they are necessary to keep the sport relevant. On the field, there were plenty of standout performances, including Aaron Judge's hot start and Shohei Ohtani's dazzling pitching. However, there were also some early injury woes, with Justin Verlander and Max Fried both landing on the IL before the first game even began.
