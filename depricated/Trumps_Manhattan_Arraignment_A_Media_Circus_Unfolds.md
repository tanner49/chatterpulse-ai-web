# Trump's Manhattan Arraignment: A Media Circus Unfolds
### Former President Donald Trump pleads not guilty and faces a storm of opinions
#### April 04, 2023

## Introduction
In a whirlwind of media coverage and opinions, former President Donald Trump has submitted to arraignment in Manhattan, pleading not guilty. As the first former US president in history to face a criminal case, Trump's indictment has sparked a frenzy of reactions from podcasters and commentators alike.

## The Sides
On one side, some argue that the indictment is politically motivated and unjust, with The Liz Wheeler Show calling it an "unjust arraignment" and The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show accusing DA Alvin Bragg of twisting campaign finance law to charge Trump. Others, like The Bulwark Podcast, suggest that Trump is getting a taste of his own medicine after calling for his enemies to be prosecuted.

Meanwhile, some commentators are focusing on the potential impact of the indictment on Trump's political future, with Up First questioning whether it could affect his presidential bid. The Daily suggests that the impending arrest could actually make Trump a stronger candidate for 2024.

## What People Are Saying
