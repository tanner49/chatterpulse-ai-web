# Tennessee House Expels Two Democrats Over Gun Protest
### A heated debate on gun control leads to the expulsion of two young Black lawmakers
#### April 10, 2023
## Introduction
In a controversial move, the Republican-controlled Tennessee House of Representatives voted to expel two young Black Democratic lawmakers, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, after they led a protest on the chamber floor in response to a recent deadly school shooting in Nashville. The expulsion has garnered national attention and sparked a heated debate on gun control, the role of protests in politics, and the implications for democracy.

## The Sides
On one side, supporters of the expulsion argue that the lawmakers' actions during the protest were disorderly and broke decorum, justifying their removal.
