# The TikTok Ban Debate
### The proposed ban on TikTok sparks a heated debate among politicians and influencers
#### April 01, 2023

## Introduction
The proposed ban on TikTok has been a hot topic of discussion among politicians and influencers alike. While some argue that the app poses a threat to national security due to its Chinese ownership, others believe that the ban would be an assault on Americans' freedoms. The proposed "Restrict Act" has been the subject of much debate, with some arguing that it would give the government sweeping power over anything deemed a security threat. 

## The Sides
Those in favor of the ban argue that TikTok's links with China and allegations of surveillance highlight the threat that the social media app may pose to national security. They also point to the fact that the app has been accused of manipulating content to push ideologies that weaken the U.S. while restricting those same ideologies in China. On the other hand, those against the ban argue that it would be a dangerous assault on Americans' freedoms, giving the government too much control over what is deemed a security threat. They also argue that the proposed legislation is a dangerous "Patriot Act for the internet."
